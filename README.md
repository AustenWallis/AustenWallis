## Hey, I‚Äôm Austen üññ! (@AustenWallis)

#### I work in Astronomy, Computational Astrophysics (ML/DL), Quantitative Finance and Architecture/Construction. 

- üìñ I‚Äôm currently studying as a 2nd-year postgraduate researcher in (Astro)physics at the University of Southampton (June 2024).

- üå¨Ô∏è My PhD research is on emulating complex and imperfect astrophysical systems for accretion disk winds in quasars. This is for the rapid emulation of the Radiative Transfer Code, '[Python](https://github.com/agnwinds/python)' (coded in C).
  - My code is called '[Speculate](https://github.com/AustenWallis/Speculate)' and is accessible through the linked GitHub repository. Speculate currently is a PCA Gaussian Process Emulator, where 'Python' spectral data is reduced in dimensions, and the weight space is interpolated to mimic any region not defined by a grid point. The 4-year project aims to introduce novel methods to accurately match 30+ physical parameters from physically imperfect simulations (due to incorrect or missing theories) to real observational data. More info can be found in Speculate's cookbook.

- üìà I'm also developing as a hobby my own private repository code, Silvanus, a quantitative trading/backtesting script. I spend my free time self-learning quantitative finance, transferring my Astro, Maths and Statistics education and research to new datasets pulled from the Bloomberg terminal. 
  
###### üì• Feel free to contact me to collaborate with accretion disk winds or fun quantitative problems.
