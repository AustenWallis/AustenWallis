- 👋 Hi, I’m @AustenWallis
- 👀 I’m interested in astronomy, compuational astrophysics, quantitative finance and architecture/construction. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying as a 1st year post-graduate researcher in (astro)physics at the University of Southampton (Oct 2022). Project work is on emulation of complex and imperfect astrophysical systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with accretion disk winds, or fun quantiative problems.
