## Hey, I’m Austen 🖖! (@AustenWallis)

#### I work in astronomy, computational astrophysics, quantitative finance and architecture/construction. 

- 📖 I’m currently studying as a 1st year postgraduate researcher in (Astro)physics at the University of Southampton (Oct 2022).

- 🌬️ My project work is on emulation of complex and imperfect astrophysical systems based on the accretion disk winds in quasars. This is for the rapid emulation of the Radiative Transfer Code, 'Python'. 

- 📈 I'm also developing as a hobby my own private repo code, Silvanus, a quantitative trading/backtesting script. (Private while constructing until a public demonstration is possible)

###### 📥 Feel free to contact me to collaborate with accretion disk winds, or fun quantiative problems.
###### Email at riggs491@gmail.com, it's a spam email account, i'll pick it up :)
