## Hey, I’m Austen 🖖! (@AustenWallis)

#### I work in Astronomy and Computational Astrophysics (ML/DL)!

- 📖 I’m currently studying as a postgraduate researcher in (Astro)physics at the University of Southampton.

- 🌬️ My PhD research is on emulating complex and imperfect astrophysical systems for accretion disk winds in quasars. This is for the rapid emulation of the Radiative Transfer Code, '[Sirocco](https://github.com/agnwinds/sirocco)'.
  - My code is called '[Speculate](https://github.com/sirocco-rt/speculate#)' and is accessible through the linked GitHub repository. Speculate currently is a PCA Gaussian Process Emulator, where spectral data is reduced in dimensions, and the weight space is interpolated to mimic any region not defined by a grid point. The 4-year project aims to introduce novel methods to accurately match physical parameters from physically imperfect simulations (due to incorrect or missing theories) to real observational data. More info can be found in Speculate's cookbook.
